                If you are wanting to buy scripts for yourself then you can go to the store icon which essentially 
                brings you out to the market of all of the sales script scripts that have been uploaded. When you 
                first go to the store screen it will look very familiar to the current scripts page except their will 
                be additional information for all scripts on the second part of the table. These will be obviously the 
                price of the script and also their will be a review section where you can click on reviews and you can
                 read reviews from other people that have bought the script. If a script is a fake script or they are 
                 just overloading a whole lot of rubbish just so they can make money then their reviews will soon 
                 indicate this.

            You will also notice that on the left-hand side of the menu is a filter bar where you can filter all of 
            your searches. You may want all scripts from a particular industry that have been on the system for no
             more than a year and are under a price of $5.00. This enables you to get the right script that you need
              more effectively and without any fuss plus if you use this filter option effectively you could probably 
              get some great value scripts that out, they’re in the market that most people wouldn’t be aware of.

                There is a shopping cart that you use and once you have clicked on the purchase icon for the scripts 
                then it will add to your shopping cart and once you have finished you can click on the cart and perform 
                the final transaction.
                <p>
                Once you have purchased a script it will immediately come up on your current scripts menu where you can use it for cold calling.
